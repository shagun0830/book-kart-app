          <b>Our Mission</b>: To help local, independent bookstores thrive in
          the age of ecommerce.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Our Vision</b>: We work to connect readers with independent
          booksellers all over the world. We believe local bookstores are
          essential community hubs that foster culture, curiosity, and a love of
          reading, and we're committed to helping them survive and thrive. Our
          platform gives independent bookstores tools to compete online and
          financial support to help them maintain their presence in local
          communities.

          <b>Our Story</b>: Book-Kart began as an idea to help support
          bookstores and their communities at a time when more and more people
          were buying their books online. We saw an opportunity to create an
          alternative to Amazon for socially-conscious online shoppers. Amazon
          sells over 60% of all books in the US and is growing. That shift
          threatens the future of bookstores and will hurt readers, authors, and
          publishers who rely on a diverse, healthy ecosystem for books.{" "}
          <b>
            We had a better idea — give readers the convenience of online
            shopping while supporting independent bookstores at the same time

            <summary><b>Why does Book-Kart discount books?</b></summary>
            <p>
              We are still experimenting with discounting. If we find discounts
              are necessary to be a viable alternative for our customers, we may
              continue to discount books. But to minimize the price difference
              between in-store purchases and online purchases, we will limit
              discounts to 10% and under. All discounts come out of
              Book-Kart's share of the profits, not the bookstores.
